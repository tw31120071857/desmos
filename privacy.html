<div class="summary-highlight"><strong>Summary</strong>: If you or your School provides us with Student Data via Desmos Classroom, your School is acting as the data controller for the Student Data, and our processing of such Student Data is governed by our agreements with your School. Such agreements may impose greater obligations on Desmos than described in this Privacy Policy.</div>
<p>Our Desmos Classroom services may be used by third party providers of educational services, such as schools, school districts, school systems, teachers or other instructors (collectively referred to as &quot;<strong>Schools</strong>&quot;).</p>
<p>When Desmos contracts with a School to provide a Service through student.desmos.com to students of the School (“<strong>Students</strong>”), we may have access to Student Data (defined below). We consider Student Data to be highly confidential and our processing of Student Data is governed by our Student Data Privacy Statement, our Terms of Service and/or our written agreements with the applicable School.</p>
<p>Please see our <a href="/studentdata">Student Data Privacy Statement</a> for additional information about how we collect and use Student Data gathered during the provision of the Desmos Service to Schools.</p>
<p>If you represent a School in the United Kingdom or European Economic Area, you can review our standard, template DPA with attached SCCs <a href="https://desmos.com/privacy-pdfs/Desmos_DPA_and_SCC_2021-06-17_v3.pdf">here</a>.

<h2 id="information-collected">3. Information Collected</h2>
<div class="summary-highlight"><strong>Summary</strong>: We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us such as name, email.</div>
<p>a. <em>Personal Data You Disclose to Us</em>.
You can use most of our Services, including the Desmos Tools, and, as a student, Desmos Classroom, without registering for an account with Desmos. If you choose to create an account on the Service, or communicate with Desmos, you may provide to Desmos certain information by which someone could personally identify you, such as your name, email or unique username (“<strong>Personally Identifiable Information</strong>”), passwords and similar information used for authentication and account access (“<strong>Security Information</strong>”), as well as information about yourself such as your employment or level of schooling by which someone could not personally identify you (“<strong>Demographic Information</strong>”). When we link Security Information or Demographic Information to your Personally Identifiable Information, we treat all of it as Personally Identifiable Information. We also collect information (i) when you save or post content to the Service, (ii) if you expressly authorize us to access your device camera and photo roll to upload pictures to the Service, and (iii) and if you communicate with us via email or otherwise.</p>
<p>We refer to all of this data collectively as “<strong>Personal Data</strong>”. We may also collect limited Personal Data about you from a third party Internet site or service. For example, if you login to your Desmos account through Google or another authentication tool, or if you interact with Desmos on social media, we may collect the Personal Data you authorize that third party service to share with us, such as email address or name.</p>
<p>We do <strong>not</strong> knowingly collect: (i) exact geolocation data, (ii) behavioral data for advertising purposes, (iii) biometric / health data, or (iv) sensitive data, as defined under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (including, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade-union membership, and the processing of genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person's sex life or sexual orientation).</p>
<div class="summary-highlight"><strong>Summary</strong>: Some information – such as IP address and/or browser and device characteristics – is collected automatically when you visit our websites or apps.</div>
<p>b. <em>Usage Data</em>.
We automatically collect certain technical usage information when you use our Service (“<strong>Usage Data</strong>”).

Typically, this information is collected through log files, web beacons, browser cookies, or other device identifiers that may uniquely identify your browser or device. You may be able to set your web browser to refuse all cookies, and your mobile device to not provide your mobile device identifier. You may not be able to delete or disable cookies on certain mobile devices and/or certain browsers. For more information on cookies, please review the <a href="/cookiepolicy">Desmos Cookie Policy</a> or <a href="https://www.allaboutcookies.org/">www.allaboutcookies.org</a>.

In addition, our Service may use third party analytics and bug tracking software (including, without limitation, Google Analytics and Bugsnag) to collect further Usage Data regarding the online usage patterns of our users and bugs in our Services. We may combine Usage Data with Personal Data in a manner that enables us to trace Usage Data to an individual user. If we do so, we will treat such combined data as Personal Data.</p>
<p><strong>We do not authorize third party advertising networks or other third parties to collect information about your browsing behavior from our website for advertising purposes.</strong></p>
<h2 id="use-of-information">4. Use of Your Information</h2>
<div class="summary-highlight"><strong>Summary</strong>: We process your Personal Data for purposes based on legitimate business interests, the fulfillment of our contract with you, compliance with our legal obligations, and/or your consent.</div>

<p><strong>To facilitate account creation and logon process with your Consent</strong>.

Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile information about you from your social media provider. The profile information we receive may vary depending on the social media provider concerned, but will often include your name and e-mail address.</p>
<p><strong>To enforce our terms, conditions and policies for Business Purposes and Legal Reasons.</strong></p>
<p><strong>To respond to legal requests and prevent harm for Legal Reasons</strong>. If we receive a subpoena or other legal request, we may need to inspect the User Information we hold to determine how to respond.</p>
<p><strong>For other Business Purposes</strong>. We may use your User Information for other Business Purposes, such as (a) improving the quality and design of the Services and to create new features and services by storing, tracking, and analyzing user preferences; (b) remembering information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you use our Service; (c) providing custom, personalized content and information; (d) monitoring aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, pages viewed, etc.; (e) diagnosing and fixing technology problems and otherwise planning for and enhancing our Service and (f) for providing you with customer support.

<p><strong>For Marketing Messages, with your consent</strong>. We will not use your email address or other Personal Data to send you marketing messages unless you provide your consent, or as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-out. You can always opt-out of receiving promotional email from us by clicking on the “unsubscribe” feature at the bottom of each email. We may, however, use your email address without further consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes, such as notifying you of important Service changes or for customer service purposes.</p>
<h2 id="disclosure-of-info">5. Disclosure of Your Information</h2>

We use industry standard SSL (secure socket layer technology) encryption to transfer Personal Data. Other security safeguards include but are not limited to data encryption, firewalls, physical access controls to buildings and files, and employee training. In addition, we enter into contracts with all third-party entities or agents that participate in an onward transfer of Personal Data, and seek contractual security assurances from such third parties.

<h2 id="childrens-privacy">9. Children’s Privacy</h2>
<div class="summary-highlight"><strong>Summary</strong>: We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under the applicable age of digital consent, unless (i) a School has collected prior parental / guardian consent or (ii) the applicable parent / guardian has provided consent directly to Desmos.</div>
